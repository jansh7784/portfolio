## Root Cause Analysis (Original Issues)

After investigation, the main issues identified were:

1. **Firebase Configuration Missing**: The app was trying to initialize Firebase using environment variables that didn't exist
2. **Deprecated API Usage**: The app was using deprecated `useViewportScroll` from framer-motion  
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: All `VITE_FIREBASE_*` environment variables were undefined

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Firebase Environment Configuration
- Created `/app/.env` file with proper Firebase configuration values
- Added all required Firebase environment variables:
  - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
  - VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN  
  - VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL
  - VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
  - VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
  - VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
  - VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
  - VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

### 2. Updated Deprecated API Usage
- Replaced `useViewportScroll` with `useScroll` in:
  - `/app/src/App.tsx`
  - `/app/src/components/SpeechBox.tsx` (3 occurrences)

### 3. Dependencies Installation
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies were properly installed

## Final Status: âœ… FULLY RESOLVED

Both the portfolio homepage and freelance integration are now fully functional:
- âœ… Original portfolio displays all content properly with no Firebase errors
- âœ… New freelance portfolio accessible via `/freelance` route
- âœ… All personal information updated to Ansh's details
- âœ… Navigation and interactive elements working correctly  
- âœ… Professional design and branding consistent throughout
- âœ… Both desktop and mobile responsive layouts implemented
